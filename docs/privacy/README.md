# Privacy Policy for Text Hoarder Chrome Extension

Effective Date: February 10th, 2024

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy applies to the Text Hoarder Chrome Extension ("Text
Hoarder", "the Extension", "we", "us", or "our") and aims to inform users
("you", "your", or "user") about the policies regarding the collection, use, and
protection of their data when using the Extension.

The Extension is open-source, and its source code is available at
https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/text-hoarder/.

## Who is requesting access to your GitHub repository data?

The Text Hoarder Chrome Extension, developed and maintained by
[Max Patiiuk](https://max.patii.uk), requests read and write access to your
GitHub repository data.

## What data are we requesting?

We request read and write access to a single GitHub repository specified by the
user. This access is necessary to save webpages as markdown files directly to
your repository, and for computing statistics based on the saved data.

## Why are we requesting access to your GitHub repository data?

We request this access to enable the Extension to provide the following features
and functionalities:

- Saving pages directly as markdown into a GitHub repository specified by the
  user.
- Computing statistics based on the data saved in the repository.

Other features of the extension do not rely on access to your GitHub repository
data. The extension can be used without granting access to your GitHub
repository, but the features mentioned above will not be available.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data beyond the
necessary GitHub repository access**. The Extension processes data locally on
your device and only interacts with GitHub's APIs to read from and write to your
specified repository. No data is transmitted to any third-party services, except
for a single network request during authentication as required by GitHub to
resolve the OAuth token (this can not be done client-side due to security
implications).

## No Analytics or Tracking

Text Hoarder does not use any form of analytics, tracking, or crash reporting
tools within the Extension. Our commitment is to ensure your privacy and protect
your data from being shared or analyzed.

However, in interest of all users of the extension, we do encourage you to
[report any issues you encounter and feature requests](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/text-hoarder/issues/new/choose)
on GitHub.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary to reflect
changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
Significant changes will be communicated by updating the policy on this page
with a new effective date. Your continued use of the Extension after such
updates will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the revised
Privacy Policy.

The Privacy Policy is stored in a GitHub repository, and changes to the policy
are
[tracked in the repository's commit history](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/text-hoarder/commits/main/docs/privacy/README.md).

## Limited Use Disclosure

Text Hoarder's use and transfer of information received from GitHub APIs adhere
to GitHub's API Services User Data Policy, including the requirements for
limited use.

By using the Text Hoarder Chrome Extension, you consent to this Privacy Policy
and agree to comply with GitHub's API Services User Data Policy, including its
requirements for limited use.

Your use of GitHub's services may be subject to GitHub's

and
[Privacy Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)
