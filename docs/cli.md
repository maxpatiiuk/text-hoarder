## (macOS) Get High-Quality Text-To-Speech Voices

On macOS, high-quality Siri's voices are available for text-to-speech using the
"say" CLI command, as well as using the
["Spoken Content"](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/have-your-mac-speak-text-thats-on-the-screen-mh27448/mac)
accessibility feature.

To download these, follow
[Apple's tutorial on adding a new voice](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-the-voice-your-mac-uses-to-speak-text-mchlp2290/mac#:~:text=and%20speaking%20rate.-,Add%20a%20new%20voice,-You%20can%20add).
In the list of voices, search for a section called "English (US) - Siri" (or
other language, as long as the name ends with "Siri") - these are the highest
quality voices available.

After downloading, make sure to
[select it as the default voice](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-the-voice-your-mac-uses-to-speak-text-mchlp2290/mac#:~:text=in%20alert%20messages.-,Choose%20a%20voice,-On%20your%20Mac)
