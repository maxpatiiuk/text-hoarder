Note, to experience all features, you need to create a GitHub repository for
Text Hoarder to use as storage.

To see stats of your saved articles, you need to install a command line utility.
[See instructions](./docs/cli.md).

If you prefer a less technical experience, I would recommend
[GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app/) as a more beginner-friendly alternative to
this extension.
